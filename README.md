This is for a rocketry project.  It uses tracking, remote, and onboard logging to keep track of the rocket's location and howmany G's it pulls.
Additionally, functionality is being added for electroincs control over control surfaces for future purposes.
Right now, the board is a general development board, with plans to further refine design as physical rocket tests andcontrol surface research advance.
All physical rocket files are stored on google drive.
